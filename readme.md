## The plan

- code generation
  - fix selection when the caret at the end of the comment
  - understanding the language based on the context
  - the whole class should be provided as the context?
  - generated code can (should?) have explanatory comments?
  - dialog for method creation (having session or history to be able to continue changing the method)
- readme.me generation
- providing the whole project as a context for code explanation actions
- checking the code, suggesting improvements
- refactoring existing code (with a dialog?)
